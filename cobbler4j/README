Cobbler4j
=========

Bindings for Cobbler XMLRPC to make them feel more like Java objects.
Originally derived from work done for http://fedorahosted.org/spacewalk and then
modified.

The code is autogenerated.  Run "make" to build the project.

   * ant, python, and javac are required.  
   * code generation requires an installed version of cobbler 2.0.2 or higher
   * to run tests ... first implement the tests, and then run them :)  
         meaning, we need to write those sometime.
